ankibuffer is application to mine words from windows clipboard.
doesnt need any dependencies, ready to go exe file.
a lot of bugs could be seen, early raw version.

How to use:
1. Launch your Anki application.
2. Launch ankibuffer.exe (make sure Anki is launched).
3. Use Ctrl + C to copy text wherever you want, this triggers Anki to open "Add" window and place text from clipboard into front side.
